Once there was an assassin. This was not long ago. It was, let us say, last Tuesday.
She did not live in a far off, or magical land. She lives in San Francisco, with three roommate to keep rent low.
Sarah is average, all around, unremarkable even. Sarah couldn't, and wouldn't, hurt a fly.
But she is an assassin, an online assassin. An assassin of character.
And she has just found out that she is very, likely terminally, ill.
