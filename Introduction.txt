Once there was an assassin. This was not long ago. It was, let us say, last Tuesday.
She did not live in a far off, or magical land. She lives in San Francisco, with three roommate to keep rent low.
Sarah is average, all around, unremarkable even. Sarah couldn't, and wouldn't, hurt a fly.
But she is an assassin, an online assassin. An assassin of character.
And she has just found out that she is very, likely terminally, ill.

Of course, Sarah never intended to become an assassin, even of the non-fatal variety. No one who has met Sarah would think that she was capable of such harm. Which is what makes her so incredibly effective at her job. It was in the 11th grade, when her best friend had her heart broken by Tom Durbin after 4th period that Sarah discovered how incredibly deadly she could be with the aid of technology. But thatâ€™s another story entirely. In the present, Sarah was in desperate need of a replacement.

Now you would think that finding a replacement assassin would be rather difficult given the secrecy of the job. However, by putting an add on craigslist for a gardener specializing in winter plants, specifically the Japanese Maple, that serves as the secret code for seeking out an assassin in a public forum. Having an add out for 3 weeks with no response, Sarah was becoming a bit more desperate.

She started to search more unconventional areas. Reddit forums were full of "trolls". But none of these people
had a light enough touch in Sarah's mind. Her job requires finesse, and the cretins flooding message boards
with calls of "MAGA" just wouldn't do. Her clients were the type that require something a bit more cutting.
